## Goal :
To perform Attribution Modelling  for Criteo Attribution Bidding Dataset and to optimize the Budget Allocation for various Marketing campaigns.
## Attribution Modeling
Attribution modeling is a framework for analyzing which touchpoints, or marketing channels, receive credit for a conversion.Each attribution model distributes the value of a conversion across each touchpoint differently. 
A model comparison tool allows you to analyze how each model distributes the value of a conversion. 

## Types of Marketing Models we will be implementing-

Single Touch Attribution Models:
Last touch Attribution
First Touch Attribution
Multi-Touch Attribution Models:
UShape Attribution
Time Decay Attribution
Position Decay Attribution
Reverse Decay: Position
Linear Attribution
